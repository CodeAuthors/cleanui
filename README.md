# Clean UI

A clean SASS responsive UI framework built around HTML5 elements and intuitive class names.

Get Started by using any HTML5 website (using tags like: HEADER, SECTION, FOOTER, etc.) and see how Clean UI can help transform it to a clean website instantly without any helper classes.

Should you need more flexibility or have a custom website, please use our special class names for refinement.

### To install:
Run the following command inside your nodejs project:
```JavaScript
npm i @codeauthors/cleanui
```
OR
```JavaScript
yarn add @codeauthors/cleanui
```

## Basic
In react:
```JavaScript
import '@codeauthors/cleanui';
```

## Advanced
Inside your own 'style.scss' file add the following:
```Scss
@import '@codeauthors/cleanui/style.scss';
```

### To overide:
Before your @import add any overrides:
```Scss
$primary-color: red;
$primary-color-shadow: darkred;
```
